PHPUnit runner for Vim
----------------------------------

PHPUnitQf is a plugin for Vim that allows you to run PHPUnit tests easily from the Vim window. It then reads the output and puts the errors into the quickfix list, so you can easily jump to them. It's configurable too, so if you use a PHPUnit wrapper command or have a special set of arguments, then that's no problem.

How to use
----------------

In a Vim window, run:

:Test <args>
Where <args> are passed directly to the PHPUnit command. To set up a custom PHPUnit command see the configuration section below. You can also set default arguments which will always be passed.

Configuration
-------------------

By default, the command used to run PHPUnit is phpunit, but you can change it in your vimrc file with:

let g:phpunit_cmd = "/usr/bin/mytest"
To pass arguments to the command, use:

let g:phpunit_args = "--configuration /path/to/config"
You can also specify arguments to be placed after the "dynamic" argument (the argument passed when running from within Vim):

let g:phpunit_args_append = "--repeat"
The output is written to a temporary file. You can change the location of this (default value is /tmp/vim_phpunit.out) with:

let g:phpunit_tmpfile = "/my/new/tmp/file"
